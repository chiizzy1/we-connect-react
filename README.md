## Lessons Learned

I ran into so many bugs while building this project and every single time I always found a way to fix the issue. The biggest lesson for 
me is that there's always a fix to every problem, I just have to use google / stack overflow more and there're always more experienced Devs willing to help, all I gotta do is ask.
